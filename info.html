  Hey :)
  <br>
  I'm a frontend engineer who has always loved the intersection between web development and
  and discovering the reasons that lie behind why people like certain things. Right now I'm working as a developer for 
  ISGMH, a research institute in Chicago that focuses on technical solutions for studies on LGBT populations.

  In my free time, I work on production house and electronic music and work on my DJ sets.
